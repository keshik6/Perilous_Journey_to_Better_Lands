# The Perilous Journey to Better Lands
## Exploring undocumented refugee graveyards
People around the world are constantly trying to better their lives, with many far more fortunate than refugees, those forced to escape their homelands to avoid conflict, persecution or natural disaster. In a bid to flee these dire conditions, they inevitably travel using untrodden and dangerous routes, leading to many deaths.

By looking at how migrant flows, as well as major points at which many deaths occur, are affected by the incident that precipitated the outward migration from the region and other contemporaneous events, it is hoped that future migrant flows can be predicted. By knowing where people will go, and where they are most likely to run into resistance or danger, aid agencies may be better equipped to deal with migrant crises around the world, giving these refugees a shot at a better life.
